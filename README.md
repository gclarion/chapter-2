#Chapter 2: Objects and Primitive Data

##Overview

During this chapter you should begin to feel comfortable with the declaration of variables, and discuss what happens at each point in declaring an object, creating an instance of that object, assigning vs. changing the state of the object and how that differs from what happens with primitive data.  You will begin to do mathematical calculations and should come to understand both the mathematical operators and their precedence.

##Reading Assignment
